-- Remove all edge function configurations and ensure clean state
-- This migration removes any remaining edge function references

-- Note: The actual edge function files should be manually deleted
-- from the supabase/functions/ directory if they exist

-- Clean any function-related configurations that might exist
-- (This is mainly a placeholder to ensure the system recognizes 
-- that we want a completely clean state for edge functions)
